# Sparse Solvers
_High performance L1 minimization solvers for Python and Tensorflow. (Work in progress.)_

## Releases

_(TODO)_

## Setup, Build & test

First, clone the repository and its submodules:

    > git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rayglover-ibm/sparse-solvers
    > cd sparse-solvers

### Requirements

At a minimum, you will need:

- CMake 3.3
- A reasonably compliant C++14 compiler, e.g.:

    | Windows    | Linux                 | Mac       |
    |:----------:|:----------------------|:----------|
    | VS 2015    | gcc 5.3 / clang 3.6   | XCode 7.3 |


### Build

Build using CMake in the typical way:

```bash
> mkdir build && cd build
> cmake ..
> cmake --build . [--config Release]
```

There are a number of _sparse-solvers_ specific CMake options:

| CMake option                 | Description            | Default |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| `sparsesolvers_WITH_TESTS`   | Enable unit tests      | ON      |
| `sparsesolvers_WITH_BENCHES` | Enable benchmarks      | OFF     |
| `sparsesolvers_WITH_PYTHON`  | Enable python binding  | OFF     |

Lastly, you might find some of these CMake options useful; I've included them here as a reference:

| CMake option               | Description            | Default |
|----------------------------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| `OpenBLAS_microarch`       | OpenBLAS CPU microarchitecture to use | NEHALEM |
| `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE:FILEPATH=<path-to-python-executable>` | Override the python location | <small>System specific</small> |

### Build â€“ Python Package

To build the python package (`.whl`) you will need the relevant Python development package, such as `python-dev` for Debian/Ubuntu. For Windows/Mac I recommend [Conda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html). To build the wheel:

```bash
> mkdir build-py && cd build-py
> cmake -Dsparsesolvers_WITH_PYTHON=ON ..
> cmake --build . --target bdist_wheel [--config Release]
```

Once the wheel has been created (usually in `build-py/bindings/python/dist`) you can install it with `pip` locally in the usual way:

```bash
> pip install <path/to/sparsesolvers.whl>
```

### Tests / Benchmarks

All tests and benchmarks can be run via CMake:

```bash
>  ctest -C Release -VV
```
